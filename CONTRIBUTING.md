# Contributing to Spiritual Design Patterns

**Bless you, Developer.**
(愿你平安，开发者。)

We welcome contributions from all denominations, sects, and architectural preferences. Whether you are a Monolith (Catholic) maintainer or a Serverless (Zen) enthusiast, your code is welcome here.

## 🕊️ The Prime Directives (最高指令)

1.  **Keep the Metaphor (保持隐喻):**
    All contributions MUST interpret religious concepts using **Computer Science/Software Engineering** terminology.
    * ❌ Bad: "Buddhists believe in reincarnation."
    * ✅ Good: "Buddhism implements a recursive `Reincarnation()` loop until the `Nirvana` break condition is met."

2.  **No Flame Wars (禁止圣战):**
    This repository is for **humor and structural analysis**, not for theological debate.
    * Discussions about which "OS" is better will be closed and marked as `wontfix`.
    * Respect the legacy code, even if it's deprecated.

3.  **Code Style (代码风格):**
    * Use `Markdown` for all documentation.
    * Ensure all "Deities" are Singleton classes (unless documenting Polytheism, then use Array/List).

## 🛠️ How to Propose a New Religion (如何提交新宗教)

1.  **Fork** this repository (Create your own Sect).
2.  Create a new file in the appropriate directory (`src/` or `legacy/`).
3.  Follow the template structure:
    * **Class Definition**
    * **Core Architecture**
    * **Known Bugs**
4.  Submit a **Pull Request** (Theological Thesis).

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

If you find a theological inconsistency:
* Open an **Issue**.
* Label it as `theological-debate` or `logic-error`.
* Do not assign it to God (He does not check GitHub notifications).
